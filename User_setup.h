// Define the SPI clock frequency, this affects the graphics rendering speed. Too

// The ESP32 has 2 free SPI ports i.e. VSPI and HSPI, the VSPI is the default.
// If the VSPI port is in use and pins are not accessible (e.g. TTGO T-Beam)
// then uncomment the following line:
#define USE_HSPI_PORT

// Comment out the following #define if "SPI Transactions" do not need to be
// supported. When commented out the code size will be smaller and sketches will
// run slightly faster, so leave it commented out unless you need it!

// Transaction support is needed to work with SD library but not needed with TFT_SdFat
// Transaction support is required if other SPI devices are connected.

// Transactions are automatically enabled by the library for an ESP32 (to use HAL mutex)
// so changing it here has no effect

// #define SUPPORT_TRANSACTIONS
